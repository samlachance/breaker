# BREAKER
Breaker is a bash script that reminds you to take a break from your work!

## What you need
You need the tts terminal program **festival**

If you're on debian like I am, you can just type

```
apt-get install festival
```

## How to use
Pass the number of minutes you would like between reminders as the argument.

```
./breaker.sh 20
```
would start breaker from your current directory with a reminder interval of 20 minutes.
